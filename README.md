# MultiGraph
Software component acting as a simulator and aiming to help in the deployment of novel Attack Graph (AG) models. 
It is intended to help comparing these novel approaches with already existing designs and implementations. 
It has also as an objective to determine those aspects of existing models that have not been completely defined or specified by their authors and thus may need some completion before being used in lab or real attack scenarios.  

### Features
* AG import from MulVAL XML files (w.r.t. specific rules file, to be uploaded here)
* Manual configuration of the AG
* Optimization problem solutions:
	* Poolsappasit et al. - SOOP & MOOP
	* Wang L. et al.
* Interactive graph
* Export CSV lists of optimal recommendations
* Comparisons of different methods and strategies - TODO
